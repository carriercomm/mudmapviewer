        <p>
        MudMapViewer is a Mac OS X Application designed to allow users to 
        view CMud map files. At this point, only the SQLite map files are 
        supported. I believe that corresponds to version 3 of CMud.

        <h2>Mud Client Integration</h2>
        In order to effectively use MudMapViewer while playing your mud,
        you will want to include integration scripts into your Mud client
        that facilitate updating the state of MudMapViewer. Essentially
        the point of these scripts is to detect changes to the current
        room and notify MudMapViewer to change the "current room" value.
